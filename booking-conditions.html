    <h2>TRAVEL INSURANCE</h2>
    <p>It is a condition of booking that you agree to take out some type of travel insurance to cover any unforeseen <br>

        Whilst it is extremely rare that we would cancel a trip we believe travel insurance is a wise investment. <br>
        
        This insurance will not only cover us should you not be able to make the trip but also yourself should a weather event
        result in the cancellation of your trip. <br>
        
        Whilst it is extremely rare that we would cancel a trip we believe travel insurance is a wise investment. <br>
        
        It is a condition of booking that you agree to take out some type of travel insurance to cover any unforeseen events. <br>
        
        Before taking any travel insurance from any company, please read the full product disclosure statement and be satisfied 
        that the policy provides you with appropriate cover for fishing in South African domestic waters, as well as sufficient 
        cancellation coverage for the trip and your travel expenses. <br>
        
        In the event that a trip is cancelled due to weather-related circumstances, we cannot accept responsibility for any loss 
        of trip costs, airfares, lost holiday time or any other financial consequences as a result of the booking. <br>
        
        We make every effort to conduct all trips on time and to the proposed itinerary, however we are unable to take you fishing
         in the event that a tropical cyclone warning or a strong wind warning is issued by the Bureau of Meteorology for all or
        part of your trip, in the event of any other natural disaster that prevents us from running your trip, or if wind speeds 
        exceed the safe operating limits specified for our operation by the SA Maritime Safety Authority. Financial 
        consequences of any fishing time that is missed and any travel connections or accommodation bookings that need to be 
        changed as a result of these unforeseen weather events, is to be claimed on travel insurance.</p>

    <h2>WEATHER CANCELLATIONS AND DELAYS</h2>
    <p>Cancellations/delays due to weather are at the discretion of the skipper/guide. Guests will be notified as soon as possible 
        regarding any delays or cancellations due to weather. In the event that a trip is cancelled or delayed, due to a strong 
        wind warning, tropical cyclone warning or other natural disaster, or other weather conditions that exceed operational safety 
        limits, the travel insurance you have taken out will need to cover cancellations or reductions in trip length, any rescheduling 
        of flights and accommodation. We do not offer a trip refund for weather-related delays, cancellations, or reductions in trip
        length, but we will do everything possible to ensure that you have everything you need to make a claim on your travel insurance.</p>

    <h2>SAFETY</h2>
    <p>We take your safety very seriously in the remote environments we operate. Please advise us if you have any medical conditions 
        which we need to be aware of. We also ask that you tell us of any allergies or food related issues so we can cater accordingly. 
        Please advise us of this well in advance of your trip. If there is a chance that you may require an EPIPEN in the event of an 
        allergic reaction, please make sure you bring one with you, and that you alert our crew as to its location and use.

        Boats have an AMSA required medical kit onboard and our crew are trained in First Aid. However, we need you to be aware that 
        you are travelling to a remote location and while we have taken every step to ensure your safety, there are still risks involved 
        with being in a remote location, should a medical emergency occur.
        
        We take the duty of care to each and every guest very seriously, but it must be accepted that risks still exist. When joining 
        one of our fishing trips, you do so with the understanding that we cannot be held liable for any harm that may come to you as 
        a result of this trip. You also agree to adhere strictly to all safety procedures and instructions given by the skipper/crew/guide 
        at all times.</p>
