                  <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant_trevally">GT's </a>can be classified as apex predators as they hunt a variety
                    of species, from lobsters and mantis shrimps to eels and smaller
                    trevally species, in the deep waters around the islands as well
                    as the flats and lagoons of the atolls. They are a powerful force
                    to be reckoned with and holding up one of these impressive specimens
                    is well worth the battle</p>

                    <h1>Fly Fishing Daytrips</h1> 
                     <p><a href="https://www.hatchmag.com/saltwater-fly-fishing">Saltwater fly fishing</a> is a breathtaking and thrilling sport that
                        allows anglers to immerse themselves in the natural beauty of the ocean. 
                        The beauty of saltwater fly fishing lies in the challenge it presents, requiring 
                        anglers to master casting techniques, understand the behavior of fish, and adapt 
                        to changing conditions.

                        As the sun rises and sets over the endless expanse of water, anglers cast their 
                        lines and wait for that thrilling tug on the end of their fly. The excitement of hooking a powerful saltwater fish, such as a marlin or a tuna, is unparalleled.
                        
                        Beyond the thrill of the catch, saltwater fly fishing offers a chance to 
                        connect with nature in a way that few other sports can. Whether you're 
                        wading in the surf, floating in a boat, or casting from shore, you'll be 
                        surrounded by the majesty of the ocean and its incredible inhabitants.</p>

            <p>You will be amazed by its waters teeming with aggressive predatory fish, 
                that include giant trevally, bonefish, triggerfish, permit, barracuda, 
                bluefin trevally, snapper, grouper and algae eaters like the turbo-charged milkfish.
            
                If you venture into the blue water you can put your skills to further test by targeting 
                the healthy populations of sailfish, wahoo, yellowfin tuna, dogtooth tuna, dorado, 
                and even marlin.</p>

                <p>A trip that i will never forget. Well organised and deadly at finding the Fish. <br>
                    Everything was well prepared and we felt comfortable and safe on the water. <br>
                    The meals were absolutely delicious, and the fact that i caught my own lunch <br>
                    made it that much more memorable. <br>
                   I cannot wait to do another trip with Captain Jamo and crew! Thank you <br>
